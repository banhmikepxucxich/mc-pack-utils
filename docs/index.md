# Welcome to this stupid website for Minecraft pack making utilities.

## Description

So normally I don't give out binary builds because well I don't like to. Because of that, you have to install the programming language + libraries and run it yourself. Though I might give out some binary builds if I feel like so. 

## Table

Click on link for source :D

| Script name | Programming Language | Libraries |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [Recolor Block](../RecolorBlock/RecolorBlock.py) | Python 3 | ktinker, pillow |
| [Recolor Sword](../RecolorSword/RecolorSword.py) | Python 3 | ktinker, pillow |
| [Recolor Wool, Clay](../RecolorWool/RecolorWool.py) | Python 3 | pillow |

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have python already, latest release of **[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**
2. Make sure you have the **libraries**.
   1. **Check** with `pip3 list`
   2. If missing, **install** with `pip3 install <packagename>`
   3. Yes I know I suck at giving instructions just search google or something
3. Now **cd** to the script root, and `python3 <script name>`
4. **Examples** are *in the scripts' folders* so yeah.
